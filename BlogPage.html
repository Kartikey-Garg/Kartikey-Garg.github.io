                    In this vast multiverse (theoretically) 
                    Who are we ?
                    How are we ? 
                    Where are we ? 
                    Are we alone ?
                     Are we the first to explore ? 
                    Or we are last to see ?
                    How much is beyond us ?
                    There are infinite questions generated in our mind when we talk about our LONELINESS IN SPACE.
                    
                    To find out a solution 1 of our great scientist named 'Dr. Frank Drake' proposed an equation in Green Bank Facility in 1961 named "Drake's Equation".
                    
                    # This equation simply estimates the number of alien civilization that are present in our Galaxy.  with whom we can communicate 
                    The results comes out to be 100,000,000 living civilization are hiding in our Galaxy itself.
                    Then where are they. #
                    
                    This could be possible that they may see us what we was millions of years ago.
                    
                    Today if we talk about in terms of Civilization we are at 0.74 type of civilization and its logarithmic (By Kardashev Scale). </p>

                <h2>Bootstrap Paradox</h2>
                <p>In very simple words, its a theoretical Paradox . Lets understand by an example:-
                    Suppose you are giving an object to yourself in the past (BY TIME TRAVELLING). Now, the object that you choose in your present to give in your past will get trapped in an infinite loop in which the object does nit have any time of origin and is said to be "UNCAUSED" or "SELF-CREATED".

                    More simplar form

                    You took an object in your present, travelled back in time and give that object to yourself.
                    Now logically the object is no longer with you cause you have given it in past but you will find that object in your present because you gave that object to yourself in past.
                    Now for that object no one can determine the time of origin because if in past at that time that object was not created and you gave it to yourself then it shows that the object is made before the actual formation of that object. This is contradicting and so one can not determine the time of its cretion because it was present when it ws not created</p>

                <h2>GRANDFATHER PARADOX</h2>
                <p>By the name it is clear that its something going to be related with ensistors & science 

                    well its very simple - READ CAREFULLY
                    
                    GRANDFATHER PARADOX is a paradox in Time Travel in which inconsistencies(fact) emerge through changing the past
                    the name was kept simply by a statement of a man that "If one can travel in past & try to do changes in it like killing his grandfather to prevent one's birth & we know that we are totally based on our past , thern if he/she killed his grandfather than how could they be existed
                    This is the simplest way by which we can understand what is GRANDFATHER PARADOX
                    
                    A  Physicist John Garrison performed An experiment of sending a signal to turn off itself in time travel & he found that by travelling the signal in time them machine received that signal before he send it.</p>
