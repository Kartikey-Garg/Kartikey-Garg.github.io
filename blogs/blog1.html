    <h1>Drake's Equation</h1>
    <p>In this vast multiverse (theoretically)</p>
    <p>Who are we ?</p>
    <p>How are we ? </p>
    <p>Where are we ?</p>
    <p>Are we alone ?</p>
    <p>Are we the first to explore ?</p>
    <p>Or we are last to see ?</p>
    <p>How much is beyond us ?</p>
    <p>There are infinite questions generated in our mind when we talk about our LONELINESS IN SPACE.</p>
    <p>To find out a solution, one of our great scientists named 'Dr. Frank Drake' proposed an equation in Green Bank Facility in 1961 named "Drake's Equation".</p>
    <p>This equation simply estimates the number of alien civilizations that are present in our Galaxy with whom we can communicate.</p>
    <p>The results come out to be 100,000,000 living civilizations are hiding in our Galaxy itself.</p>
    <p>Then where are they?</p>
    <p>This could be possible that they may see us as we were millions of years ago.</p>
    <p>Today if we talk about in terms of Civilization we are at 0.74 type of civilization and its logarithmic (By Kardashev Scale).</p>
