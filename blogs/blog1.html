    <h1>Drake's Equation</h1>
    <p>In this vast multiverse (theoretically) 
        Who are we ?
        How are we ? 
        Where are we ? 
        Are we alone ?
         Are we the first to explore ? 
        Or we are last to see ?
        How much is beyond us ?
        There are infinite questions generated in our mind when we talk about our LONELINESS IN SPACE.
        
        To find out a solution 1 of our great scientist named 'Dr. Frank Drake' proposed an equation in Green Bank Facility in 1961 named "Drake's Equation".
        
        # This equation simply estimates the number of alien civilization that are present in our Galaxy.  with whom we can communicate 
        The results comes out to be 100,000,000 living civilization are hiding in our Galaxy itself.
        Then where are they. #
        
        This could be possible that they may see us what we was millions of years ago.
        
        Today if we talk about in terms of Civilization we are at 0.74 type of civilization and its logarithmic (By Kardashev Scale).</p>
