    <h1>GRANDFATHER PARADOX</h1>
    <p>By the name it is clear that it's something going to be related with ancestors & science.

        Well, it's very simple - READ CAREFULLY:
        
        GRANDFATHER PARADOX is a paradox in Time Travel in which inconsistencies emerge through changing the past.
        The name was kept simply by a statement of a man that "If one can travel in the past & try to do changes in it like killing his grandfather to prevent one's birth & we know that we are totally based on our past, then if he/she killed his grandfather then how could they exist?"
        This is the simplest way by which we can understand what is GRANDFATHER PARADOX.
        
        A physicist John Garrison performed an experiment of sending a signal to turn off itself in time travel & he found that by travelling the signal in time the machine received that signal before he sent it.</p>
