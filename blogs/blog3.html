    <h1>GRANDFATHER PARADOX</h1>
    <p>By the name it is clear that its something going to be related with ensistors & science 

        Well its very simple - READ CAREFULLY
        
        GRANDFATHER PARADOX is a paradox in Time Travel in which inconsistencies(fact) emerge through changing the past
        the name was kept simply by a statement of a man that "If one can travel in past & try to do changes in it like killing his grandfather to prevent one's birth & we know that we are totally based on our past , thern if he/she killed his grandfather than how could they be existed
        This is the simplest way by which we can understand what is GRANDFATHER PARADOX
        
        A  Physicist John Garrison performed An experiment of sending a signal to turn off itself in time travel & he found that by travelling the signal in time them machine received that signal before he send it.</p>
