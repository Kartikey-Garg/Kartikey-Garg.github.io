    <h1>PREDESTINATION PARADOX</h1>
    <p>As the name suggests 'There is something before its destination'. More simply I should say that something who is arriving before its Actual Arrival, like you yourself.
<br>
        This paradox is similar to Bootstrap Paradox. It is because in both cases there is a loop of an incident occurring again and again that you will see later in this blog.
        <br>
        Let us understand it in very amazing language and examples:-
        <br>
            Example 1. Suppose you want to go back in time to discover the origin of time and let's assume that you got a brand new Time machine and you traveled 3.7 Billion Years back in time to look for the 1st origin of life. Now there are 2 simple concepts:
        <br>
        Before explaining this let's assume the exact time of origin of life be 'T'. So now we are ready to understand the concepts, let's go>>>>>>
        Now if you reach before time T, you will find yourself as the origin of Life because at times only you are the single living organism.
        If you reach after time T, you will be able to see the 1st living organism, but still, you do not know how this life originated, from where it originated.
        Let's suppose you arrive at exactly Time T, in that condition :
            There are 2 living organisms at the time of origin of life (1 that comes naturally, another you who arrives from Time Travel.)
        Here loop is you are continuously going back in time to look for the 1st origin of life, and the same incident is happening with you again & again.
        But what if you reached and destroyed the origin of life ??? In that case, there may be completely different of Naturally origin of life.......
        <br>
                Example 2. Similarly for a fire, you go back in time to see the 1st beauty of human-caused fire and if you lit a matchstick there then that's the 1st origin of Human-caused fire.......
        Hre loop is you are going back after every new timeline to look for the cause of the fire and causing the fire yourself again & again.</p>
